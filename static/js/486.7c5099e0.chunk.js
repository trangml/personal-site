I love AI and robotics, and hope to use my RL and\ncomputer engineering background to help others in unique ways.\n\n# Currently\n\n- I work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an Autonomous Systems Engineer.\n- I am in the Advanced Capabilities and Systems Group in the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Department\n- I collaborate with students and faculty on MIT campus, specifically [Prof. Luca Carlone](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/luca-carlone/)\n- I work with the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot to do cool things\n\n# Previously\n\n- At Shield AI, I worked on the DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials (ADT)\n- In my first internship with Shield (then Heron Systems), I worked on creating novel reward schemes and\n  developing a transformer model for an RL Fighter Jet agent\n- I've learned how to build ML/RL pipelines for complex tasks, work as\n  a part of large, well-performing teams, develop relationships with customers, and build cutting-edge technologies.\n\n# Some history\n\n- Born in Oklahoma, moved to Northern Virginia\n- Early fascination with robotics and vehicles\n- Attended Patriot High School, where I was part of the Governor's School Program. This gave me the opportunity to take classes at George Mason University.\n- Attended Virginia Tech for Undergrad, where I studied Machine Learning within the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department\n- Attended Virginia Tech for my Masters, where I wrote a thesis titled [Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning: From Single-Agent to Multi-Agent Systems](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/113085), under the tutelage of the wonderful [Dr. Thinh Doan](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/doan.html)\n- Moved to Massachusetts to work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory\n  \x3c!-- I was born in Oklahoma and moved to the Northern Virginia Area in 2008. I was introduced to robotics in middle school --\x3e\n  \x3c!-- with VEX robotics and have been set on a path of engineering ever since. VEX robotics taught me the basics of --\x3e\n  \x3c!-- engineering, teamwork, and documentation. My childhood was also built upon a love for reading, as I read basically any --\x3e\n  \x3c!-- book I could get my hands on. I actually once received a plaque from the Governor's wife in commemoration to my --\x3e\n  \x3c!-- dedication to reading and accumulating AR points. In high school, I attended the Governor's School --\x3e\n  \x3c!-- at Innovation Park, which allowed me to take my STEM classes at George Mason University. It was here I took my first programming course and I quickly came to love it, participating in coding competitions such as Lockheed --\x3e\n  \x3c!-- Martin's CodeQuest, and programming robotics behaviors for autonomous sections for VEX. --\x3e\n\n# I like\n\n- Basketball (OKC Thunder!!!)\n- Mechanical Pencils\n- Football (Minnesota Vikings!)\n- Anime/Manga\n- Productivity Tools\n- [Good design](/)\n- Reading\n- [Minecraft](https://minerl.io/)\n- Geoguessr\n- Quantum Physics\n- [Ricing Linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I have labeled hundreds of dolphin bones for the Smithsonian\n- I have never left [Kentucky Kingdom](https://www.kentuckykingdom.com/) without winning a stuffed animal.\n- My hometown of Moore, Oklahoma has been struck by two category 5 tornadoes since 1999.\n- I can solve a Rubik's cube in 43.3 seconds (got lucky one time).\n\n# I dream of\n\n- scuba diving in a healthy Great Barrier Reef.\n- humans and AI co-existing to improve society.\n- how we can avoid AI destroying society.\n- building things that help people.\n- being a 10x engineer.\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},(function(e){if(null==e)throw new TypeError("Cannot destructure undefined")}(e),e));return(0,c.jsx)(a.rU,(0,o.Z)({},n))},u=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Matthew Trang",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(a.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(i(),{source:l,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}},4942:function(e,n,t){function o(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}t.d(n,{Z:function(){return o}})},1413:function(e,n,t){t.d(n,{Z:function(){return i}});var o=t(4942);function r(e,n){var t=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);n&&(o=o.filter((function(n){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,n).enumerable}))),t.push.apply(t,o)}return t}function i(e){for(var n=1;n<arguments.length;n++){var t=null!=arguments[n]?arguments[n]:{};n%2?r(Object(t),!0).forEach((function(n){(0,o.Z)(e,n,t[n])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(t)):r(Object(t)).forEach((function(n){Object.defineProperty(e,n,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t,n))}))}return e}}}]);
