I love robotics, and hope to use my RL and\ncomputer engineering background to improve upon the devices that can help and protect those in need. \n\n# Currently\nAt Shield AI, I was introduced to Machine Learning and specifically Reinforcement Learning with the DARPA Alpha Dogfight\nTrials (ADT). In my first internship with Shield (then Heron Systems), I worked on creating novel reward schemes and\ndeveloping a transformer model for an RL Fighter Jet agent. The project was easily one of the coolest things I've ever\nworked on, and from it, I learned that working on ML was what I truly wanted to do.\n\x3c!-- At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthena\u2019s stack. --\x3e\n\n# Some history\nI was born in Oklahoma. I moved to Virginia. \n\nI learned programming at the Governor's School at Innovation Park\n\n# I like\n\n- Basketball\n- Space\n- Geoguessr\n- Mechanical Pencils\n- Productivity Tools\n- [Good design](/)\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I have never left Kentucky Kingdom without winning a stuffed animal.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- scuba diving in a healthy Great Barrier Reef.\n- getting good.\n- building things that help.\n- being a 10x engineer.\n\n",d=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(r.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Matthew Trang",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(r.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:h,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
