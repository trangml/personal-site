I love robotics, and hope to use my RL and\ncomputer engineering background to help others in unique ways.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt Shield AI, I was introduced to Machine Learning and specifically Reinforcement Learning with the DARPA Alpha Dogfight\nTrials (ADT). In my first internship with Shield (then Heron Systems), I worked on creating novel reward schemes and\ndeveloping a transformer model for an RL Fighter Jet agent. The project was easily one of the coolest things I've ever\nworked on, and ML and RL have fascinated me since. I've learned how to build ML/RL pipelines for complex tasks, work as\na part of large, well-performing teams, develop relationships with customers, and build cutting-edge technologies.\nI work primarily as a Machine\nLearning Enginner, but I also have broad experience as a Software Developer.\n\n\x3c!-- At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthena\u2019s stack. --\x3e\n\n# Some history\n\nI was born in Oklahoma and moved to the Northern Virginia Area in 2008. I was introduced to robotics in middle school\nwith VEX robotics and have been set on a path of engineering ever since. VEX robotics taught me the basics of\nengineering, teamwork, and documentation. My childhood was also built upon a love for reading, as I read basically any\nbook I could get my hands on. I actually once received a plaque from the Governor's wife in commemoration to my\ndedication to reading and accumulating AR points. In high school, I attended the Governor's School\nat Innovation Park, which allowed me to take my STEM classes at George Mason University.\nIt was here I took my first programming course and I quickly came to love it, participating in coding competitions such as Lockheed\nMartin's CodeQuest, and programming robotics behaviors for autonomous sections for VEX.\n\n# I like\n\n- Basketball (OKC Thunder!!!)\n- Mechanical Pencils\n- Football (Minnesota Vikings!)\n- Anime/Manga\n- Productivity Tools\n- [Good design](/)\n- Reading\n- [Minecraft](https://minerl.io/)\n- Geoguessr\n- Quantum Physics\n- [Ricing Linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I have labeled hundreds of dolphin bones for the Smithsonian\n- I have never left [Kentucky Kingdom](https://www.kentuckykingdom.com/) without winning a stuffed animal.\n- My hometown of Moore, Oklahoma has been struck by two category 5 tornadoes since 1999.\n- I can solve a Rubik's cube in 43.3 seconds (got lucky one time).\n\n# I dream of\n\n- scuba diving in a healthy Great Barrier Reef.\n- getting good.\n- building things that help.\n- being a 10x engineer.\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,c.jsx)(a.rU,(0,t.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Matthew Trang",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(a.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(r(),{source:l,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
