# Intro

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on Reinforcement Learning. I love robotics, and hope to use my RL and
computer engineering background to improve upon the devices that can help and protect those in need.

# Currently

At Shield AI, I was introduced to Machine Learning and specifically Reinforcement Learning with the DARPA Alpha Dogfight
Trials (ADT). In my first internship with Shield (then Heron Systems), I worked on creating novel reward schemes and
developing a transformer model for an RL Fighter Jet agent. The project was easily one of the coolest things I've ever
worked on, and ML and RL have fascinated me since. I've learned how to build ML/RL pipelines for complex tasks, work as
a part of large, well-performing teams, develop relationships with customers, and build cutting-edge technologies.
I work primarily as a Machine
Learning Enginner, but I also have broad experience as a Software Developer.
<!-- At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthenaâ€™s stack. -->

# Some history
I was born in Oklahoma and moved to the Northern Virginia Area in 2008. I was introduced to robotics in middle school
with VEX robotics and have been set on a path of engineering ever since. VEX robotics taught me the basics of
engineering, teamwork, and documentation. My childhood was also built upon a love for reading, as I read basically any
book I could get my hands on. I actually once received a plaque from the Governor's wife in commemoration to my
dedication to reading and accumulating AR points.

I learned programming at the Governor's School at Innovation Park, participating in coding competitions such as Lockheed
Martin's CodeQuest, and programming robotics behaviors for autonomous sections for VEX.
