# Intro

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on Reinforcement Learning. I love robotics, and hope to use my RL and
computer engineering background to improve upon the devices that can help and protect those in need.

# Currently

At Shield AI, I was introduced to Machine Learning and specifically Reinforcement Learning with the DARPA Alpha Dogfight
Trials (ADT). In my first internship with Shield (then Heron Systems), I worked on creating novel reward schemes and
developing a transformer model for an RL Fighter Jet agent. The project was easily one of the coolest things I've ever
worked on, and from it, I learned that working on ML was what I truly wanted to do.

<!-- At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthenaâ€™s stack. -->
