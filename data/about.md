# Intro

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on Reinforcement Learning. I love AI and robotics, and hope to use my RL and
computer engineering background to help others in unique ways.

# Currently

- I work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an Autonomous Systems Engineer.
- I am in the Advanced Capabilities and Systems Group in the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Department
- I collaborate with students and faculty on MIT campus, specifically [Prof. Luca Carlone](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/luca-carlone/)
- I work with the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot to do cool things

# Previously

- At Shield AI, I worked on the DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials (ADT)
- In my first internship with Shield (then Heron Systems), I worked on creating novel reward schemes and
  developing a transformer model for an RL Fighter Jet agent
- I've learned how to build ML/RL pipelines for complex tasks, work as
  a part of large, well-performing teams, develop relationships with customers, and build cutting-edge technologies.

# Some history

- Born in Oklahoma, moved to Northern Virginia
- Early fascination with robotics and vehicles
- Attended Patriot High School, where I was part of the Governor's School Program. This gave me the opportunity to take classes at George Mason University.
- Attended Virginia Tech for Undergrad, where I studied Machine Learning within the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department
- Attended Virginia Tech for my Masters, where I wrote a thesis titled [Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning: From Single-Agent to Multi-Agent Systems](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/113085), under the tutelage of the wonderful [Dr. Thinh Doan](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/doan.html)
- Moved to Massachusetts to work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory
  <!-- I was born in Oklahoma and moved to the Northern Virginia Area in 2008. I was introduced to robotics in middle school -->
  <!-- with VEX robotics and have been set on a path of engineering ever since. VEX robotics taught me the basics of -->
  <!-- engineering, teamwork, and documentation. My childhood was also built upon a love for reading, as I read basically any -->
  <!-- book I could get my hands on. I actually once received a plaque from the Governor's wife in commemoration to my -->
  <!-- dedication to reading and accumulating AR points. In high school, I attended the Governor's School -->
  <!-- at Innovation Park, which allowed me to take my STEM classes at George Mason University. It was here I took my first programming course and I quickly came to love it, participating in coding competitions such as Lockheed -->
  <!-- Martin's CodeQuest, and programming robotics behaviors for autonomous sections for VEX. -->

# Fun facts

- I have labeled hundreds of dolphin bones for the Smithsonian
- I have never left [Kentucky Kingdom](https://www.kentuckykingdom.com/) without winning a stuffed animal.
- My hometown of Moore, Oklahoma has been struck by two category 5 tornadoes since 1999.
- I can solve a Rubik's cube in 43.3 seconds (got lucky one time).

# I dream of

- scuba diving in a healthy Great Barrier Reef.
- humans and AI co-existing to improve society.
- how we can avoid AI destroying society.
- building things that help people.
- being a 10x engineer.
